			<h2>Our Institute</h2>
			<p>We understand the importance of education and the well-being of our students. We strive to create a safe and nurturing environment where students can thrive academically and personally.

			<h2>Leave Policy Management</h2>
			<p>Our student leave policy management system, students are allowed to take leave for medical or personal reasons. In such cases, the student or their parent/guardian must inform the school administration in advance and provide the necessary documentation. We provide support and guidance to students during their leave, and help them to catch up on missed assignments upon their return.

                Our ultimate goal is to ensure that all students have access to a quality education and that their well-being is prioritized at all times. We believe that our student leave policy management system is an essential part of achieving this goal, and we are committed to providing the best possible support to our students and their families."</p>
